A very simple heart rate monitor for Android.

To initiate a measurement, start the app and place your finger on the camera, covering the flash as well, and keep still. The measurement takes roughly 10-15 seconds.

Once it is complete, the results, and the raw data is shown. While the app doesn't keep a log, these results can be copied.
